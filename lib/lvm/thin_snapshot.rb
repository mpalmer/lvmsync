	# Return an array of ranges which are the bytes which are different

	def differences
		# This is a relatively complicated multi-step process.  We have two
		# piles of <lv block> => <pool block> mappings, one for the "origin"
		# (the LV that's changing) and one for the "snapshot" (the LV that
		# represents some past point-in-time).  What we need to get out at the
		# end is an array of (<first byte>..<last byte>) ranges which cover
		# the parts of the volumes which are different (or that at least point
		# to different blocks within the data pool).
		#
		# This is going to take a few steps to accomplish.
		#
		# First, we translate each of the hashes into a list of two-element
		# arrays, expanding out ranges, because it means we don't have to
		# handle ranges differently in later steps (a worthwhile optimisation,
		# in my opinion -- if you think differently, I'd *really* welcome a
		# patch that handles ranges in-place without turning into a complete
		# mind-fuck, because I couldn't manage it).
		#
		# Next, we work out which mappings are "different" in all the possible
		# ways.  There's four cases we might come across:
		#
		# 1. Both origin and snapshot map the same LV block to the same data
		#    block.  This is a mapping we can discard from the set of
		#    differences, because, well, it isn't a difference.
		#
		# 2. Both origin and snapshot map the same LV block, but they point
		#    to different data blocks.  That's the easiest sort of difference
		#    to understand, and we *could* catch that just by comparing all
		#    of the mappings in the origin with the mappings in the snapshot,
		#    and listing those whose value differs.  But that wouldn't catch
		#    these next two cases...
		#
		# 3. The origin maps a particular LV block to a data block, but the
		#    snapshot doesn't have any mapping for that LV block.  This would
		#    occur quite commonly -- whenever a location in the origin LV was
		#    written to for the first time after the snapshot is taken.  You
		#    would catch all these (as well as the previous case) by taking
		#    the origin block map and removing any mappings which were
		#    identical in the snapshot block map.  However, that would fail to
		#    identify...
		#
		# 4. A block in the snapshot is mapped, when the corresponding origin
		#    block is *not* mapped.  Given the assumption that the snapshot
		#    was never written to, how could this possibly happen?  One word:
		#    "discard".  Mappings in the origin block list are removed if
		#    the block to which they refer is discarded.  Finding *these* (and also
		#    all mappings of type 2) by the reverse process to that in case
		#    3 -- simply remove from the snapshot block list all mappings which
		#    appear identically in the origin block list.
		#
		# In order to get all of 2, 3, and 4 together, we can simply do the
		# operations described in steps 3 & 4 and add the results together.  Sure,
		# we'll get two copies of all "type 2" block maps, but #uniq is good at
		# fixing that.
		#
		@differences ||= begin
			diff_maps = ((flat_origin_blocklist - flat_snapshot_blocklist) +
							 (flat_snapshot_blocklist - flat_origin_blocklist)
							).uniq

			# At this point, we're off to a good start -- we've got the mappings
			# that are different.  But we're not actually interested in the
			# mappings themselves -- all we want is "the list of LV blocks which
			# are different" (we'll translate LV blocks into byte ranges next).
			#
			changed_blocks = diff_maps.map { |m| m[0] }.uniq

			# Block-to-byte-range is pretty trivial, and we're done!
			changed_blocks.map do |b|
				((b*chunk_size)..(((b+1)*chunk_size)-1))
			end

			# There is one optimisation we could make here that we haven't --
			# coalescing adjacent byte ranges into single larger ranges.  I haven't
			# done it for two reasons: Firstly, I don't have any idea how much of a
			# real-world benefit it would be, and secondly, I couldn't work out how
			# to do it elegantly.  So I punted.
